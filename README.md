# GestureRecognition

The experiment aimed to optimize a deep learning model for gesture recognition, employing various architectures and techniques to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

**Conv3D**: Conv3D was used to analyze height, width, and time dimensions, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns effectively.<br/>
**ConvLSTM2D**: It is a variant of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and introduced here to enhance temporal dependency capture in gestures.<br/>
**VGG16**: Integrated to extract high-level visual features from gesture frames.<br/>
**GRU**: Utilized to model sequential patterns and dynamics within gesture data, facilitating accurate recognition.<br/>

But during Experiment 11 the performance which reduces model complexity of Experiment 10 reduced model performance. More experiments can be run to find better hyper-parameters in order to perform better than both Experiment 10 and 11.<br><br>Even though Experiment 12 performs better than Experiment 10 models, the model in this experiment was trained by retraining all VGG16 parameters and it takes a long time to train models in this way. Experiment 10 trains a lot faster because VGG16 layers were frozen and only custom Dense and GRU layers were trained.<br><br>Test Accuracy is calculated at **80.0%** |
